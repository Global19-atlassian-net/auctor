abstract: "The content here is simply meant as a starting template, over which you can edit it using Auctor. 

This text is from the `abstract` of the [YAML frontmatter](https://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html) in the narrative markdown file.

Note that we should see the zika tree here (🐛).

You should be able to edit this very abstract in Auctor and see it update 🎉

# [Change color-by](https://nextstrain.org/zika?c=gt-NS1_349)

You should be able to edit this text, and the query etc above. Try adding `&m=div` to the query and seeing the tree x-axis update!

> Note that modifying the `dataset` doesn't work yet.



# [Slide with main-markdown content](https://nextstrain.org/zika?d=tree)

This won't be rendered currently because we're using rendering components from the Mobile view, and on the
mobile view if there is both sidebar-narrative content and main-display narrative content, only the latter is rendered.

## Main display _markdown_ **content**
